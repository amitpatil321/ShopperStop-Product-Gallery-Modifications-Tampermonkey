# ShopperStop Product Gallery Modifications Tampermonkey

This userscript enhances the product gallery on ShopperStop's website by modifying the size of the product preview images and navigation buttons. When a product image is clicked, the script resizes the image to a maximum width of 600px for better visibility. Additionally, the navigation buttons (previous and next) in the image carousel are resized to 60px by 60px for a more consistent and larger interface. The script listens for user interactions, such as clicking on images or navigation buttons, and applies these modifications dynamically.
